# Piano Radio
Piano Radio is a MIDI piano on the internet. Anyone with a MIDI keyboard can play on this piano for everyone else to hear. You can also create a room, invite your audience, and hold a private concert.

MIDI is a standard that allows electronic devices to communicate music information in terms of events (e.g. key presses). Using MIDI, you can share "live music" using much less bandwidth than that of regular audio streaming. Notes are represented as numbers, and we render them to audio through a soundfont.
