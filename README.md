Piano Radio is a MIDI piano on the internet. Anyone with a MIDI keyboard can play on this piano for others to listen. Create a room, invite your audience, and host a private concert. Piano Radio is a low-bandwidth platform for live music sharing.

MIDI is a standard that allows electronic devices to communicate music information in terms of events (e.g. key presses). Using MIDI, you can share "live music" using much less bandwidth than audio. Music notes are stored as numbers, and we render them to audio through a soundfont.
